		                 <p class="blurb">One of the most obvious differences between documents physically printed on pages of paper and documents displayed on electronic devices is that the latter can be interactive in ways that the former cannot. More than 50 years ago, this is what convinced Ted Nelson and others that when used well computers would dramatically change our relation with text. What kinds of interactivity are possible, and to what extent interactivity adds value to a document, are challenging questions that require careful analysis. </p>
<p>Deciding that some specific interactive feature would add value immediately raises a new challenge: how is that feature going to be realized? 
In this paper, we look at three different technologies that can be used to add interactivity to a document presented on the web: “plain old JavaScript”, Saxon-JS, and XForms. We examine a specific feature and compare the differences between similar implementations across these three platforms. </p>

<p class="blurb">XML is a platform-neutral way to exchange, share, and manipulate information. But what persuades many to use XML is the claim that XML provides a long-term way to store information, independent of tools (both hardware and software) with their short life spans. Projects spend significant resources on XML setup and then settle into doing the real work, using that XML infrastructure  to compile, write, analyze, or whatever it is they do. Until, one day — something doesn’t work. Hardware is retired; software is upgraded; specifications go into new releases. Users get stuck. And when they complain, we respond that “of course that doesn’t work any more, you have been accumulating technical debt for years! It is time to reinvest.” They thought they had committed to a one-time cost, and now we tell them that it is an ongoing expense. If the user had put documents into their favorite spreadsheet, they complain, they could still import them into the current version. How do we answer that complaint? We (the XMLers) think we described the values of XML plainly and fairly. We (the XML users) think that the claim that XML documents last a long time is relying on a specious technicality, and we have been trapped dishonestly. I live on both sides of this: as a user I want to invest in infrastructure once and have it last; as a developer I want to be able to improve my product without the limitations imposed by backwards compatibility. We as a community often complain that not enough people are using XML. If we really want XML use to grow, we need to address the gotcha that too many XML users are feeling.</p>

    <p class="blurb">XQuery developers deserve to have access to libraries of implementations of useful algorithms. Programmers using other programming languages have such libraries — why not us? For example, it would be nice to have a library implementation of the classic Aho/Corasick algorithm which shows how to search for multiple words — an arbitrarily large set of words in fact — in a single linear pass over the document. It’s a useful algorithm with interesting applications. But why wait for someone else to build the libraries we want? Let’s build them ourselves. And let’s start now.</p>

    <p class="blurb">“Which came first,” begins an old joke. But the more interesting question might be, “does it even matter?” There are many obvious and several not-so-obvious ways in which the order of items (be they XML elements or attributes, or JSON maps or arrays) can be understood to be significant or insignificant. These are not new questions and how they’re answered plays out across vocabulary design, schema design, and individual documents. They are important questions when it comes deciding if two documents are “the same” or “different” and to what extent.</p>

    <p class="blurb">Topic-based applications like DITA are all the rage these days, and DITA is an XML application. But what if your customer’s products are tied to industry standards that were created in SGML days? And what if the customer uses a content-management system that the vendor swears will support SGML, so the customer has little impetus for switching to XML? What, then, if the customer wants to publish HTML, and the best way of getting there is through DITA? The answer may be to look for ways to break SGML down into topic-like units. That’s a great idea, but what if their SGML is full of features that most XML software vendors have never heard of, such as graphics stored in entities? There are many tricks to pulling this off. The key to our approach is XProc pipelines running dozens of incremental XSLT steps. Climb on for a wild ride!</p>

In an attempt to preserve the data for future use, a project was launched to convert the ISE from its boutique markup and bespoke workflows to TEI and standard workflows. In this paper, we describe the markup language used by the ISE (known as IML for ISE Markup Language), various fundamental differences between IML and TEI, and the challenging work of converting and remediating the ISE’s IML-encoded files. These challenges include not only mechanical issues such as unclosed tags but also logical challenges in finding ways in the new tag set to encode concepts easily encoded in the original. Our central question is how to do this work in a principled, efficient, well documented, replicable, and transferable way. We conclude with recommendations for re-encoding legacy projects.</p>

       <p class="blurb">Presentational markup, the addition of rendering features that identify and differentiate between content objects, is familiar and ubiquitous, with origins possibly coeval with human communication. But it is not at all clear exactly what presentational markup is doing. Exactly how does presentational markup make the recognition of content objects more efficient and reliable? What are the connections with other nonlinguistic contributions to textual communication, ranging from rhetorical style to punctuation?</p>

        <p class="blurb">Client-side XSLT (CSX) is often used in scenarios where data (in XML) from a remote server is provided to a user who processes it in some way, for example rendering it locally for display. That is, the server provides the data and the client does the work on that data to make it useful. However, that is not the only scenario in which CSX is useful. In an environment in which the user already has, or is in the process of creating, XML, CSX can be a convenient and powerful tool, enabling users to perform operations on their data, securely, on their own systems. The potential for this use of CSX is illustrated with uses of Saxon-JS for several security-related applications.</p>

        <p class="blurb">There are many reasons to choose XML as a vehicle for encoding cultural heritage texts (such as the availability of applications and supporting tools), but there is simultaneously a risk of being boxed in by its model of text. Students of text are all too familiar with issues such as concurrent or overlapping hierarchies, discontinuous text, and non-linear structures that are not well served by the Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects model. Our work on the Text-As-Graph (TAG) model supports these alternative patterns, and we have working editors and repositories for TAG. Nonetheless, it is useful to be able to export XML to take advantage of the many tools that support analysis and processing. Accordingly, we are building tools to support translation of TAGML to XML for those purposes.</p>

    <p class="blurb">JATS (the Journal Article Tag Suite ANSI/NISO z39_96-2019) is a tag set of elements and attributes describing the content and metadata of journal articles. Publishers and archives worldwide have used the base JATS schemas as well as made extensive supersets and subsets. For some time, the JATS community has been requesting a new “official” JATS subset that is smaller and simpler than the existing schemas (including both journal metadata and article metadata) and that has been reduced for ease of editorial tool use. This work identifies commonly used elements and attributes of the JATS Publishing schema, through usage statistics of articles from major publishers and repositories, and builds such a minimal subset. While the authors identify a naive minimal customization based on usage, the minimal subset schema has been enhanced to include strategic structures considered necessary. For example, JATS is revised every few years, and the authors have taken into account the fact that items introduced in more recent JATS versions might be strategically critical, even though less numerous. Other functional aspects (such as accessibility, open access, and machine processability) have suggested structures to be retained, despite infrequent current usage. The resulting minimal subset was produced as a JATS DTD customization, significantly smaller than the JATS  publishing tag set.</p>

In the background, Docugami automatically deconstructs the content and creates a highly functional semantic XML representation of each document. This semantic XML representation enables Docugami to share information with line-of-business systems, create new documents coherent with previously created documents, present the information using multiple views and start process automation across an organization.</p>

    <p class="blurb">It is likely that most Balisage attendees are familiar with at least one query language for searching structured documents, for example XPath, and perhaps several others. Domain experts are often much less familiar with query languages of this kind, may find the syntactic requirements awkward, and have been trained by common web search interfaces to think they are unnecessary. This paper explores the design of a query language, Ariadne, that offers much more power than a “bag of words in a search box” without imposing a syntax that’s so unfamiliar it is likely to drive away new users. Ariadne takes inspiration from Arras and DynaText (two interactive search and retrieval systems of the 1980s and 1990s). It has a simple but expressive grammar that is amenable not only to trees but also to other models such as concurrent hierarchies, Goddag structures, multi-colored trees, and even, with restrictions, systems like LMNL.</p>

        <p class="blurb">The authors are designing a content-delivery system for a mixture of print and digitized materials (textbooks, teacher materials, tutorials, and assessments) and born-digital mathematics learning materials, all in multiple media formats. The goal is to atomize these resources into Learning Objects, to allow for rapid curriculum customization to suit varied learning contexts. Because there is a fundamentally progressive way in which mathematics is taught, and certain competencies require other prior-knowledge competencies, we propose a Competency Graph. Essentially, a competency graph is a low-level knowledge framework that underpins a state standards set, or a system of mathematical learning objectives classification. Although the competency graph solution is semantic by nature, it is not relational. We have chosen an XML representation of Resource Descriptive Framework (RDF) data. Our plan is to design an XML database storing a set of RDF associations and data pointers that correlate resources, standards, topics, related topics, competency assessment, and usage tracking. The authors have begun drafting RDF ontologies in XML, and are organizing this using eXist-dB.  We use XPath and XQuery for fine-grained searching, retrieving, and visualizing networked data. We’d like to share what we have started; we’d like your feedback.</p>

    <p class="blurb">Change tracking in XML documents runs into some of the thorniest and most intractable problems in markup languages, notably those that hover around concurrent and overlapping structures. The tracking mechanisms in the popular open-source packages <i>Apache Office</i> and <i>Libre Office</i> avoid the problems by being lossy. But it doesn’t have to be that way! We can solve many of the issues if we push change tracking to just before final XML serialization and track the changes in a write-only change log, mediated with immutable IDs. UUIDs allow us to make those IDs globally unique.</p>

        </h2>
    <p class="blurb">Classical models of string comparison are difficult to implement in XSLT, partly because they are designed for imperative, stateful programming. I propose a new XSLT function, <i>tan:diff()</i>, which is built on a non-traditional approach to finding the longest common subsequence or substring (LCS). For testing <i>tan:diff()</i>, I have assumed two strings of arbitrary length that are roughly similar to each other, typically because one is the result of editorial changes to the other. (Note: Strings can be in any language because the differences are expressed at the character level, necessary since in languages such as Chinese and Thai one cannot assume the use of the space to differentiate words.) Rather than tokenizing (on spaces, for example), gigantic strings are subdivided into large strings, with the segments processed pairwise. The <i>tan:diff()</i>, function extracts series of progressively smaller samples from the shorter of the two texts and looks for a match in the longer one on the basis of an XSLT <i>fn:contains()</i>. When a match is found, the results are separated by XSLT <i>tan:substring-before()</i> and <i>tan:substring-after()</i>. The <i>tan:diff()</i> function is efficient and fast, even on pairs of very long strings (100K to 1M characters), in part because of its staggered-sample approach, in part because of its optimization strategy for long strings.</p>

    <p class="blurb">Encoding meaningful semantic relationships in literary texts is almost as difficult as defining and identifying them. Defining the types and the components of semantic relationships that can be extracted from literary texts is challenging because literature is full of implicit and oblique messages and references. Relations may not have a clear or standard linguistic form and they often overlap. We discuss issues involved in modeling and encoding the mapping of relationships in literary and humanities texts, illustrated by the case of the ECARLE project annotation campaign. We propose using minimalistic and flexible annotation techniques to generate human annotated training data for a Relation Extraction machine learning system. Using the TEI tagset, without customization, we are able to encode the mapping of relations formed by named entities in a simple yet flexible way, open to reuse, interchange, conversion and visualization.</p>

These actions can be encoded as custom operations specific to an XML vocabulary or to a project and usually the language for defining these actions is the application language, Java, Javascript, etc. Since we are talking about processing XML documents, the best languages for processing XML are XSLT and XQuery! Let’s explore:

In addition to converting from many vocabularies to JATS, PMC needs to perform data normalization, standardizing core metadata to meet the PMC tagging guidelines, which are enforced with a style-checker. The main conversion work is currently performed by over 400 XSLT 2.0 stylesheets (c.200,000 lines of code), one full transformation per source DTD. PMC is working on a proof-of-concept that uses the XSLT 3 <i>fn:transform()</i> function to break this single conversion operation into multiple, discrete transformations that can handle article collections, schema conversion, collection-specific processing, and the data normalization necessary to produce PMC-compliant JATS.</p>

        <p class="blurb">Documents encoded with the TEI are notoriously heterogeneous: the Guidelines permit the encoding on any type of text, from tax receipts written on papyrus to Shakespeare plays or novels. This severely limits what a wholly generic processing system can do: it’s impossible to automate generation of tables of contents or extract structural metadata without possessing prior knowledge of the document internals. Citation Structures are a new feature in the TEI Guidelines that provide a way for documents to declare their own internal structure along with a way to resolve citations conforming to that structure. This will much more sophisticated generic processing.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="blurb">Many XML formats have been proposed for scriptural markup, but the format most often used by the thousands of Bible translators actively working today is a non-XML markup language called USFM (universal standard format markers), a backslash-delimited markup language which developed bottom-up as users invented new tags and persuaded programmers to support them. USFM is specialized for the problems of scriptural markup and allows relatively lightweight solutions to the problems that arise in marking up scripture. That specialization, however, makes it less well suited to the markup of lexica, handbooks, commentaries, critical apparatus, and other resources translators use in their work. Supporting such materials in interactive tools for Bible translators requires finding a way to make software deal well both with USFM for scriptural texts and various flavors of XML for scriptural and other materials. Many of the hardest problems have to do with the complexity of the documents, not with the form of markup used to encode them. There are lessons here for anyone who needs to work with heterogeneous data or live outside of a walled garden.</p>

To make certain there would be no surprises at the end, the information model was not developed starting with the easiest or most common cases, but with the 200 most complex cases, which had been showstoppers for previous attempts at conversion. The work, based in XProc 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, has been successful, and the initial effort has paid  off.</p>

    <p class="blurb">XForms! XForms defines relationships called “invariants.” When one member of an invariant relationship changes, the other member(s) are updated automatically (similar to the way spreadsheets work). Currently XForms only allows invariants to be expressed between simple values (values that can be calculated with a simple expression), while structural changes can only be detected using XForms events. Could the invariant mechanisms of XForms be extended to handle invariants that express <i>structure</i>, without resorting to events? Yes, by considering structural invariants to be just a higher-level form of invariant, where the work of the structural invariant is to rebuild networks of lower-level simple invariants. Structural invariants can then be merged into the general XForms invariant recalculation, by treating the <i>rebuild</i> phase of the XForms update mechanism as a higher-level version of the current <i>recalculate</i>.</p>

        <p class="blurb">Markup comes in many flavors. The STAR (self-defining text archival and retrieval) file format, first proposed in 1991, predates both XML and JSON, but shares many of their features: it’s a machine-independent textual format designed for simplicity of reading and writing and flexibility in the face of change. STAR is used primarily in scientific data exchange; it’s the basis for the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) and the default format used by the Protein Data Bank. STAR encompasses both a model of information and a syntax for serializing it. If we can decouple the model from the syntax, we can understand STAR better, and develop an alternate serialization format in XML.</p>

        <p class="blurb">XML documents (usually) contain lots of strings of Unicode characters, sometimes very, very long strings. Representing and processing these efficiently in Java poses several challenges. Variable-width encodings improve space efficiency at the cost of direct addressability. Operations, both string construction and the implementation of XPath functions, may require strings to be copied. Copying very large strings requires large blocks of contiguous free memory, putting pressure on the garbage collector. Conversely, a large collection of very short strings has more per-object overhead and poorer locality of reference, a critical factor in the performance of modern hardware architectures. Taking inspiration from several sources, a novel data structure called ZenoString supports direct addressing in many common cases, strings of unlimited length, and good locality of reference, while maintaining high performance.</p>

        <p class="blurb">“CSS Within” is a method of embedding CSS style rules into XSLT templates, so that the CSS rules that govern look-and-feel of elements in the result are as near as  possible to where those elements are generated. The proximity of the rules to the corresponding element generation code provides greater clarity and an increase in programmer efficiency especially when doing maintenance. CSS Within also reduces impediments both to stylesheet refactoring and to CSS changes, because the effects of making changes are more readily apparent. To make all of this work, some extension elements are proposed, and a separate pass on the stylesheet to create CSS files.</p>
