Balisage regulars will recognize many of this year’s presenters and
welcome some new points of view on familiar topics. Logistically,
technologically, we are on a new path. As markup designers, theorists,
and practitioners, we are used to tiptoeing near the edge from time to
time. I was saddened when I had to admit that Balisage-as-usual could
not happen in 2020. I was delighted when it became clear that because
we were now virtual many old friends will be able to re-join us this
year, and hope that this new format will let us welcome some newcomers

<p class="blurb">Many products make XML from Microsoft <em>Word</em>, but
consider the reverse: making Word versions of your XML documents, thus
using MS Word as an document composition engine. The
<em>Wordinator</em> enables automatic creation of high-quality
<em>Word</em> documents from XML source. It uses an extension of
the Word2DITA project’s SimpleWP (Simple Word Processing markup
language) as the input to an Apache POI-based Java application that
generates <em>Word</em> documents. XSLT generates the SimpleWP
XML, managing the mapping of source XML elements to Word constructs
and styles. I consider, in particular, the separation of concerns
between the XSLT that generates the SimpleWP XML and the Java code
that generates the <em>Word</em> documents.</p>

“that’s for data not text”. But maybe 3.0 is for you
too, really. Using DocBook as a prototypical text-application, I will
demonstrate why XSLT 3.0 solutions are just better and easier than
anything that’s been possible before. (Examples to include: CALS

<p class="blurb">Practitioners have long identified four distinct patterns for
construction of XSD schemas, known by the picturesque names
“Salami Slice”, “Venetian Blind”,
“Russian Doll”, and “Garden of Eden”, and
based on two binary choices: are all the element declarations global?
or (apart from the intended document root) local? Are all the type
definitions global? Or (apart from the built-in types) local? Informal
discussions often focus on the effect of pattern choice for schema
re-use, encapsulation, coupling, and cohesion. But a more formal
approach is needed to determine whether choice of pattern affects the
languages we can define with the schemas we can write. Do all four
patterns have the same expressive power? Or are some capable of
defining things not expressible in the others? </p>

<p class="blurb">Accessibility is not a single, straightforward concept. For a
particular user, the accessibility of any resource is determined by a
web of factors, first by the nature and severity of the disability
(cognitive, physical, or mental), then influenced by poverty, tech
access, language, and many other factors. Designing content to take
account of accessibility on this wide scale is a daunting task. Markup
is well placed to address accessibility, because markup is optimized
to encourage choice. It allows us to say what things are, and choose
later (<em>or, better, allow the user to choose</em>) what that
means for how content is displayed, printed, spoken, or otherwise
manifested in the output. It also allows us to say how things relate
to each other, so that we can easily offer choices of the same content
in different formats. Concrete examples of what this means in some
common markup outputs will highlight things we could be doing in our
own practice to encourage more accessible content creation from
markup.</p>

accessibility difference. On a page-by-page, feature-by-feature basis,
we will take a look at part of the previous Balisage Proceedings

<p class="blurb">Why should writing and coding be seen as opposing activities? Both
depend foundationally on analytical processes, and learning to code is
akin to learning a foreign language. Whether students of coding or
literature are applying an existing system such as TEI or developing
their own tools, they must think intensively about their corpus of
data, and that analysis should be reflected back into their own
writing, as well as their understanding of literature. Tagging poetry,
for example, requires decisions about different kinds of information
like names, dates, people, and places, as well as patterns such as
images, motifs, and rhyme. For the students engaged in the process,
not only is writing intensive in the moment of application, but it
intensifies over time with learning new ways of doing things and
building on the model of previous projects.</p>

<p class="blurb">With Saxon-JS, you can create web applications that run XSLT code

quality software. And the XSpec tool provides unit testing for XSLT
transforms. What could be a better match! Well, yes, there are some
challenges: XSpec running with Saxon-EE cannot access the web browser,
the DOM, or the JavaScript processor that influences your web
application. Nor does XSpec natively understand the interactive XSLT
features of Saxon-JS. We found two ways of bridging these gaps: we can
mock up the parts of the Saxon-JS operation that XSpec cannot natively
access, or we can run XSpec tests directly in the browser using
Saxon-JS. Each approach has pros and cons; we discuss how we chose
between them in a specific project involving user documentation for a
software API. </p>

<p class="blurb">Spell checking has been available in desktop tools for a long time,
but dealing with checking in XML documents presents problems that are
less likely to be found in conventional text editors, beginning with
the presence of markup interleaved with the text to be checked. Many
XML sources present additional problems because they are
transcriptions of documents with multiple or archaic languages.
Nonetheless, with an appropriate theory of language, it is possible to
build a simple tool, perhaps with an XForm interface, for interactive
checking of XML documents, even outside the scope of other XML
processing.</p>

<p class="blurb">Producing accessible content for the Web is largely (if we go by
the focus of most existing recommendations) a matter of adding
reasonably simple markup with a clear declarative meaning to
documents. How then can it be that producing really accessible content
happens so rarely? One reason is that normally-abled designers have
serious difficulty perceiving the difference between correct and
incorrect assistive markup, and existing tools do little to reduce
this handicap. We believe that better results can be achieved by using
a framework of accessible web components capable of enforcing best
practices, automated tools for checking accessibility, and a new
approach to manual tools to let developers and content creators
examine visually the accessibility markup so that they can make sense
of their impact on people with disabilities. </p>

    <p class="blurb">When going from one XML application, such as JATS, to another, perhaps HTML, the stylesheet author may not be able to follow any simple pattern of translation. Attributes that may be useful in the target may not be present in the source, or what is an attribute in the target may be an element in the source. That which is represented as a class attribute in the source might become a style attribute or even a wrapper element in the target. What conventions should the writer employ to ensure consistency, especially when the stylesheet may be combined with others, particularly in a layered application? This presentation looks at the implications of stylesheets not only for JATS but also for TEI and DocBook.</p>

<p class="blurb">Accessibility metadata statements let publishers describe the
accessibility features of their publications and make conformance
claims. Metadata properties listed in Schema.org enable accessibility
statements on a Web page that describes a publication. They also allow
statements to be embedded in a packaged publication (such as an EPUB).
Accessibility statements can describe, for example: what kinds of
media are used; which accessibility features are included (image
descriptions, math markup, video captions, etc.) and more. Hazards
(flashing images that could cause seizures) can be noted or the
absence of hazards confirmed. EPUB has some additional metadata terms
important to publications, including conformance statements with
credentials (as defined in “EPUB Accessibility 1.0”
[https://www.w3.org/Submission/epub-a11y/]. I will examine both basic
and complex accessibility metadata statements and offer resources for
learning how to implement them.</p>

It is possible to build such a focus by looking more closely at these documents, starting with the System Security Plan and the roles of key participants responsible for it.

created complex typography using non-hierarchical, line-based
typesetting systems characterized by “locator” files
which contain lines of typesetting instructions. Our mission is to
convert years of locator files that describe US government bills,
laws, and statues (etc.) into structural XML, valid to the United
States Legislative Markup (USLM) XML Schema. This was and is
complicated, as locator files, in addition to being completely
presentation-focused, use stylistic differences to communicate
semantic significance. Our iterative analysis grew the mapping
specification in stages. The conversion is in two parts. First Java
converts the locator files into hierarchical XML (the JAVA lexical,
syntactical, decomposition, and generational phases are the focus of
this paper). Then XSLT improves the resulting XML. Quality control and
testing required additional programming and the creation and
maintenance of a large set of reference samples.</p>

<p class="blurb">Micro-level textual variation is an important fact of life for
textual critics; we discuss how it can be expressed idiomatically in
markup and how the markup can be used by digital collations tools to
achieve a more refined analysis of the textual variation than is
possible when the collation tool ignores the markup. Using Virginia
Woolf’s manuscript drafts of <em>To the Lighthouse</em>
(1927) as a case study, we show that the deletions, insertions, and
rewritings which express the author’s struggle with her
materials constitute non-linear, discontinuous, and often
multi-hierarchical information structures which are easily represented
in the “Text As Graph” (TAG) hypergraph data structure,
readily expressed using the markup of TAGML, and usefully exploited by
the TAG-aware collation tool Hypercollate. Micro-level revisions do
not need to be a special case handled with ad-hoc extensions to our
markup infrastructure: we can have an infrastructure that handles them
naturally and allows us to use them comfortably to improve our
understanding of authors, and their works, and their textual
revisions. </p>

text documents is that text documents consist <em>by nature</em>
of ordered hierarchies of content objects (OHCO). But XML is used with
success for much more than text documents: math, music, vector
graphics, and more. When XML is used for diagrams, does it fit their
inner nature? What <em>is</em> the inner nature of a diagram?
Could it be that it consists of objects whose type is determined by
their content? Could it be that those objects can have a hierarchical
organization? Could it be that even in a two-dimensional space they
are ordered? Could diagrams be…ordered hierarchies of content objects?

judicious amounts of randomness to the pure order of algorithmic

The XML stack forms a palette for these works. Algorithms can be expressed
in XSLT and XQuery, randomness can be introduced through simple and
higher-order functions, and SVG can be the canvas. Along the way,
common problems of annotation, knowledge management, and searching
arise. Surprisingly, perhaps, so does issue of the separation of
form and content.</p>
